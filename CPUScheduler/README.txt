Instructions for grader:
Our main.py file contains our final modified FIFO algorithm used in Question 4.
For question 1, each algorithm (FIFO,SJF,RR) has its own separate .py file.
Questions 2-4 also each have their own .py file. 
We did our project in replit, therefore, only code in the main.py file is able to run in replit. However, if you are viewing our project in replit, you can run any individual file by typing "python [filename]" in the replit shell. 
If you are viewing our project outside of replit, each file is labeled and has a commented header indicating the question number. 
All of our individual programs write to the same "processes.csv" file.
